This is a Portfolio of projects I'm developing as I learn the Unreal Engine!

first setup I've been through is with Android. Our AR project was a real challenge to develop an AR game in the Unity Engine. As I learn more about AR and VR, along side the use of production studios having an Unreal Engine set-up as their well known "Secret", I decided to switch platforms. It's in C++, a change from C# as far as languages go. But also the Use of the platform is similar but a bit more systematic to development while comparing Unity to Unreal.

So, with this portfolio I'm developing for Unreal and Unity. I have series of projects I can do to develop a platformer game, and there are intriguing aspects I can appriciate that would help with the Unity Engine state machines as part of the Animation aspect of game development.

What I want to include is AR/VR but also I want to have a focus (with this repository) on game development for both Engines. There are different aspects of game development and it's important to know them, it's important to beable to understand how to develop the foundations of any 2d / 3d platformer, FPS / RPG games and etc. So those are the types of games I will be developing along side re-developing a 3d platformer game that was give to me at holberton school as a student (while typing this I'm still a student and in my last trimester!).

So, good times coding.
I'm sharing a few links below, the first one being of AR for setting up Unreal Engine for an APP on an Android Phone.

Also, This webpage is dedicated to overcoming some of the lessons that were challenging the first time through. There are things I can explain in the process of developing different games and projects in the Unity and Unreal engine where I can describe some of the processes and philosphies I used to understand it! And some I would like to build up with files and then publish the projects/ideas that are my own as Udemy Courses.

Anyways, thanks for reading.
